# Restaurant ChatBot

Alt School 📚final semester  assessment 


Question

You are required to build a restaurant chatbot that will assist customers in placing orders for their preferred meals. The main idea is that we want customers to send options and the backend would have a chat app that would respond to the options.

Requirements

ChatBot interface would be like a chat interface

No need for authentication but we should be able to store user session based on devices
When a customer lands on the chatbot page, the bot should send these options to the customer:
Select 1 to Place an order


Select 99 to checkout order

Select 98 to see order history

Select 97 to see current order

Select 0 to cancel order

When a customer selects “1”, the bot should return a list of items from the restaurant. It is up to you to create the items in your restaurant for the customer. The order items can have multiple options but the customer should be able to select the preferred items from the list using this same number select system and place an order.


When a customer selects “99” out an order, the bot should respond with “order placed” and if none the bot should respond with “No order to place”. Customer should also see an option to place a new order

When a customer selects “98”, the bot should be able to return all placed order

When a customer selects “97”, the bot should be able to return current order

When a customer selects “0”, the bot should cancel the order if there is.
